# p5template
A simple tool that makes it easy to setup a p5.js sketch

## Usage

To use this program, copy or move `p5template.exe` into the directory you want to create your sketch in, and run the program.

## Issues

Because this is created in Batch, there is no user input error handling so be cautious when entering data. 

## Planned Changes
* Grabbing the latest CDN links for the libraries
* Library Browser (to find other useful p5.js-related libraries)
* Error Handling (so typing the wrong thing doesn't break the program)
* More templates (ex: p5.js sketch with title)
* Ability to run the program using command line arguments
