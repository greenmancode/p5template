# p5template
A simple tool that makes it easy to setup a p5.js sketch

## Usage

To use this program, copy or move `p5template.bat` into the directory you want to create your sketch in, and run the program.

## Issues

Because this is created in Batch, there is no user input error handling so be cautious when entering data.
